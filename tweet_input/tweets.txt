"Once again, my best wishes to everyone in the conference. Thank you very much. Will leave for Rajghat &amp; pay tributes to Mahatma Gandhi."
I am sure this all-India conference will become a focal point of several innovative ideas that will help our Nation in the years to come.
Scale &amp; speed at which we have to take India's development journey requires maximum &amp; smart utilisation of latest technology.
The youthful energy that our Nation possesses is our prized asset. Giving an impetus to skill development through technology is essential.
I urge you to explore ways to provide as many services as possible through mobiles. Let us bring the world into our mobile phones!
"While we look at e-Governance, let us think about ‘mobile first’ and thus give importance to m-Governance (mobile governance)."
I am also certain that technology &amp; e-Governance will make processes simpler &amp; remove several obstacles slowing the pace of work &amp; progress.
"e-Governance is an essential part of our dream of Digital India. The more technology we infuse in Governance, the better it is for India."
We are actively working to create a robust digital infrastructure that would serve the interests of our citizens &amp; transform their lives.
"Centre is committed to realising dream of a Digital India, with a vision to make India a digitally empowered society &amp; knowledge economy."
"Am particularly delighted that the theme of this year's conference revolves around digital governance, skill development &amp; employability."
I am also told that 22 awards will be presented in 12 categories. I congratulate all the award winners &amp; laud their efforts.
The participants &amp; their expertise make this conference a perfect forum to look at the way forward to effective &amp; efficient e-Governance.
"Am told this conference brings together several delegates from Central &amp; State Govts, Armed Forces, Academia, Industry &amp; private sector."
"I thought- despite not attending, how can I connect with you. That is when I decided to use technology &amp; talk to you via this medium."
"I wanted to personally attend the conference but was unable to do so. However, there was no way I could miss interacting with you."
Good morning friends! I am delighted to join the 18th National Conference on e-Governance through Twitter.
On Martyrs' Day I pay homage to each &amp; every Martyr who laid his or her life for our Nation. Their bravery &amp; courage will always inspire.
पूज्य बापू को उनकी पुण्यतिथि पर शत् शत् नमन। My tributes to Pujya Bapu.
